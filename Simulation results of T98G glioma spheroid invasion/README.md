## Simulation results of T98G glioma spheroid invasion ## 
This folder contains all the R code and simulation results regarding the ABC application on the reference dataset derived from the T98G glioma spheroid invasion patterns.  

Folder **Glioma processing** contains the code that transforms the observed glioma invasion patterns (in glioma images) into numerical dataset. 

Folder **T98G glioma spheroid simulation results** contains the R code and detailed simulation output regarding the non-error calibrated version of ABC application on the reference dataset.
