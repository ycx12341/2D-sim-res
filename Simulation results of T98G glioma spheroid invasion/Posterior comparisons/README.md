## Posterior comparisons ## 
This folder contains the comparison plots between the error calibrated ABC posteriors and the non-error calibrated ABC posteriors, and the code used to generate them. 

Folder **Glioma err calib run 2** and **Glioma non err calib run 2** contain the plots of the probability densities for the parameter samples obtained at the end of each round of the corresponding simulation study. See the README.md file for each folder for more details. 

File **Posterior_comparisons.m** reads in the final parameter samples from both attempts and generates the comparisons plots, then save them as .png files in the folder.
