## Posterior comparisons ## 
This folder contains the comparison plots between the error calibrated ABC posteriors and the non-error calibrated ABC posteriors, and the code used to generate them. 

File **Posterior_comparisons.m** reads in the final parameter samples from both attempts and generates the comparisons plots, then save them as .png files in the folder.
