## Simulation results of SCC invasion ï¼ˆ3rd experiment) ##

In this final experiment regarding the simulation study of SCC invasion patterns, we introduced time-dependent parameters to the individual-based model. In other words, certain parameters in the model had the flexibility to have different values at different periods of the invasion process. 5 SCC patterns were fitted together instead of separately like we did in the 2nd experiment. 


Folder **Run 1**, **Run 2** and **Run 3** contain the necessary code and simulation output regarding the current experiment. Check the README.md file of **Run 3** -- the run chosen to represent the final simulation outcome of the current experiment for more details.

Folder **Time dependent models** contains the chosen regression model fitted to the final estimates of the 2nd experiment regarding the simulation study of SCC. 

Folder **Posterior analysis** contains the comparison plots of prior and posterior parameter densities. 

Folder **CT on run 3** contains the coverage test results on the final parameter samples from the run chosen as the final result.

Folder **Average results** contains the post-processing of the final results for each run.
