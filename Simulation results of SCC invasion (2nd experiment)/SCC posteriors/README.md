## SCC posteriors ##
This folder contains the plots of parameter density evolutions and their posterior densities for each pattern's inference.  

File **Post_process.m** reads in the **.txt** files which store the posterior samples for each pattern, generates the density plots and save them as **.png** files in the main folder. 

Folder **SCC d3 run 3**, **SCC d6 run 2**, **SCC d9 run 1**, **SCC d12 run 1** and **SCC d14 run 2** contains the plots of parameter density evolutions.
