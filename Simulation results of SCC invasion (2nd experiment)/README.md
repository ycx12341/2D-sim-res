## Simulation results of SCC invasion ##

As explained in the main body of the thesis, since the invasive features of tumour cells may change at different periods of the invasion process, we conducted the simulations on each pattern separately. Considering the stochastic nature within the individual-based model, we carried out the each pattern's simulation for 3 times with different seed being used in the random number generator (**set.seed()** command in R).

Folder **Day x simulations** contains the necessary code and simulation output regarding the corresponding pattern. Check the README.md file of each folder for more details.

Folder **SCC posteriors** contains the evolution plots of parameter densities at the end of every round and the posterior density plots of each pattern's inference.

Folder **SCC patterns processing** contains the reference numerical dataset derived from the original patterns.
